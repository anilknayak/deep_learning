# Deep Learning
This repository will provide different approaches to prior search paper implementation along with that I will also design new model to train
and predict, using supervised and unsupervised learning through deep learning methods. As we speak about deep learning, this a
vast area of research interest and many researchers have been researching for couple of decades to resolve real world problem
associated with image, video and text analysis. Many has come up with great and nobel solutions. Still this area is continuously
evolving. As we have seen the trends of evolution of AI, deep learning comes in every aspect of AI now a days.

This repo will cover many prior research model evaluation and implementation sor the same. I will also provide my new design 
approach to the deep learning model and try to evolve with the AI. Following are the topic will evolve in the repo.

## Generative model
1. Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
## CNN to classify face
## Bayesian deep learning
## Adversarial learning
## Reinforcement learning
## Natural Language Processing
## Image captioning
