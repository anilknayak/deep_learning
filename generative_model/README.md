# Generative Adversarial Network
GAN is a discriminative model. This model mainly comprises of two parts
1. Generative models can generate new data instances.
2. Discriminative models discriminate between different kinds of data instances.

3. Generative models capture the joint probability p(X, Y), or just p(X) if there are no labels.
4. Discriminative models capture the conditional probability p(Y | X).
